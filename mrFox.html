    Fantastic Mr. Fox is on the run! The three
    meanest farmers around are out to get him. Fat Boggis, squat
    Bunce, and skinny
    Bean have joined forces, and they have Mr. Fox
    and his family surrounded. What they don't know is that
    they're not dealing
    with just any foxâ€“Mr. Fox would never surrender.
    But only the most fantastic plan ever can save him now.
